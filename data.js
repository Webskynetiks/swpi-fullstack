      <p>Weights are predominantly needed for performance tests and routine testing of balances and scales. In metrological terminology, a distinction is made between reference weights or "mass standards" (to calibrate other weights) and certified weights. National regulations and international recommendations define the error limits of certified weights.</p>
      
      <p>Weights are classified into tolerance limits which are defined either by OIML or ASTM. The conventional weight value (and not the mass) is used as the nominal value of the weight. For a high level of accuracy, certified weights are calibrated and traceable back to primary standards, which are usually national standards maintained by a National Metrology Institute (NMI).</p>
      
      <p>This fundamental understanding of calibration weights is crucial for anyone working with precision weighing instruments, as it forms the foundation for accurate measurements and reliable results in various industries including laboratories, manufacturing, and quality control.</p>

      <h3>OIML Weight Classes</h3>
      <p>Weight classes are separated according to the error limits that are classified either according to OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology) or ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) declarations as follows.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Class E1 weights</strong> are intended to ensure traceability between national mass standards and weights of class E2 and lower (i.e. F1 and F2). Class E1 weights or weight sets shall be accompanied by a calibration certificate.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Class E2 weights</strong> are intended for use in the initial verification of class F1 weights and for use with weighing instruments of accuracy class I. Class E2 weights or weight sets shall always be accompanied by a calibration certificate.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Class F1 weights</strong> are intended for use in the initial verification of class F2 weights and for use with weighing instruments of accuracy class I and class II.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Class F2 weights</strong> are intended for use in the initial verification of class M1 and possibly class M2 weights. They are also intended for use in important commercial transactions (e.g. precious metals and stones) on weighing instruments of accuracy class II.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Class M1 weights</strong> are intended for use in the initial verification of class M2 weights and for use with weighing instruments of accuracy class III.</p>

      <p><strong>Class M3 weights</strong> are intended for use with weighing instruments of accuracy class IIII.</p>
      
      <h3>ASTM Weight Classes</h3>
      <p><strong>ASTM Class 0:</strong> Used as primary reference standards for calibrating other reference standards and weights.</p>
      
      <p><strong>ASTM Class 1:</strong> Can be used as a reference standard in calibrating other weights and is appropriate for calibrating high-precision analytical balances with a readability as low as 0.1 mg to 0.01 mg.</p>
      
      <p><strong>ASTM Class 2:</strong> Appropriate for calibrating high-precision top loading balances with a readability as low as 0.01 g to 0.001 g.</p>
      
      <p><strong>ASTM Class 3:</strong> Appropriate for calibrating balances with moderate precision with a readability as low as 0.1 g to 0.01 g.</p>
