SWPIâ€™s Test Weights are designed for the verification and calibration of weights and weighing instruments in medium or ordinary accuracy classes. These weights are manufactured with a mild steel fabricated body filled with molten cast iron, providing a smooth surface and fine finish. Weights with nominal values from 100kg to 1000kg are made in a rectangular shape, fitted with welded channels and a lifting pin, making them suitable for lifting by forklift or crane.

A specially designed adjusting cavity, sealed with an Allen screw, allows for fine adjustment and can accommodate an additional 500g to compensate for wear and mass loss during use. Each weight is protected with a durable coat of black paint, which provides rust resistance and ensures long-term durability.`;
